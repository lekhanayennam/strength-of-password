# strength-of-password
Evaluated passwords of different strengths using an online checker, analyzed results, and summarized best practices for creating secure passwords.

# Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

## 📌 Objective
To test multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity, analyze their strength using an online password checker, and document best practices for creating secure passwords.

---

## 📝 Steps Performed
1. Created 6 sample passwords (weak → strong).
2. Tested each on **passwordmeter.com** (or similar checker).
3. Captured screenshots of the strength results (`pw1.png … pw6.png`).
4. Documented:
   - **Best practices** for strong password creation → [`best_practices.md`](best_practices.md)
   - **Common password attacks & definitions** → [`common_attacks.md`](common_attacks.md)

  - `common_attacks.md` → Overview of common password attacks and their frequency
- **README.md** → This report

## 📊 Summary
- **Weak passwords** (short, only letters/numbers) scored low due to predictability.  
- **Medium passwords** improved with added length and symbols but still had patterns.  
- **Strong passwords** combined length, randomness, and multiple character types, making them much harder to crack.  

---

## ✅ Takeaways
- Longer + more complex = exponentially harder to brute-force.  
- Use **unique passwords** per account (no reuse).  
- Prefer **passphrases** with random words and separators.  
- Store securely with a **password manager**.  
- Always enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
