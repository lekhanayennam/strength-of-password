## How Password Complexity Affects Security ##

1. More character types = higher entropy (randomness).
-If a password uses only lowercase letters, there are 26 options per character.
-Adding uppercase, numbers, and symbols increases the pool to ~95 characters.
-That makes brute-force or dictionary attacks take exponentially longer.

2. Length + complexity together = strongest.
-A short complex password (e.g., P@ss1) is still weak.
-A long password with mixed types (e.g., Tr@vel!ng-Coffee*2025) is much harder to crack.

3. Predictable substitutions don’t add much.
-Attackers know P@ssw0rd! is just “password” with substitutions—it’s still weak.

## Best Measures for Complex Passwords ##

1. Minimum length 12–16+ characters (longer = stronger).
2. Use all character sets: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
3. Avoid predictable patterns: names, birthdays, common words, keyboard sequences (12345, qwerty).
4. Prefer passphrases: multiple unrelated words with separators (Shark!Violin*Teal_92).
5. Unique per account: never reuse passwords across sites (stops credential stuffing).
6. Use a password manager: generates and stores strong, random passwords for each account.
7. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): even if a password leaks, attackers can’t log in without the second factor.
